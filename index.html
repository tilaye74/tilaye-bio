<h1>Space Physicist | Forecast Modeler | Data Enthusiast</h1>

<section class="bio">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate space physicist with deep expertise in space weather forecasting,
    solar magnetic field analysis, and proxy modeling. With several years of experience
    working on high-impact forecasting models like MagPy, I blend domain knowledge
    in solar physics with programming, data analytics, and machine learning.
    I earned my Doctor of Natural Sciences degree (Dr. rer. nat) in Astronomy in March 2011 from the International 
    Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) on Physical Processes in the Solar System and Beyond, a joint program between 
    the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and the Universities of Braunschweig and Göttingen in Germany. 
    Prior to that, I completed both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Physics at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia.
</p>
<p>
Following my Ph.D., I undertook postdoctoral research positions at two leading institutions: first at the Max Planck 
Institute for Solar System Research in Germany, and subsequently at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA, USA, under 
a NASA grant. After Drexel, I was awarded the prestigious NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellowship, which allowed 
me to support NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission through advanced modeling and data analysis.
</p>
<p>
My primary research interests lie in the numerical modeling of magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere, which are fundamental to 
    understanding nearly all dynamic solar phenomena, including solar flares, prominence eruptions, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). 
    These explosive events are driven by the Sun’s intense magnetic activity, particularly in and around sunspot regions, and can 
    significantly impact space weather conditions near Earth. As part of my research, I contributed to the development of predictive numerical models that 
    are integrated into NASA’s Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) under the Living With a Star (LWS) initiative. 
    These tools are designed to forecast solar eruptions and improve operational space-weather forecasting.
</p>
<p>
I played a lead role in developing a comprehensive suite of modeling tools to simulate the quasi-steady evolution of 
    magnetic fields in solar active regions, utilizing observations from instruments such as the Helioseismic and Magnetic 
    Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the SDO, as well as ground-based solar observatories like SOLIS-NSO. 
    My work also extends to the study of solar energetic particles (SEPs), which are typically accelerated by solar flares or CMEs. 
    We investigate SEP transport through realistic three-dimensional models of the coronal and interplanetary magnetic fields t
    o better understand their propagation and potential impacts.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I serve as a Research Engineer with the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) at NASA Johnson Space Center. 
    In this role, I support both the International Space Station (ISS) and the Artemis program through real-time mission 
    operations and the development of predictive radiation environment models. My work contributes directly to mitigating 
    the effects of space weather on human spaceflight and is integral to future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current work focuses on enhancing the accuracy and operational capability of
    models that predict solar flares, CMEs, and other solar phenomena using real-time
    SHARP/HMI data from NASA/SDO. I am particularly interested in the intersection of
    scientific research and practical forecasting tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also committed to open science and collaboration, and I actively contribute to
    repositories and development efforts within the space weather community.
